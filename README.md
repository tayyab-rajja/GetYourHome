## Instructions

Thirdhoem is a revolutionary new application combining the latest in AI, ML, GPT, SEO, VR, and ROYGBIV. It only needs to be built first. Instructions below.

The muckety-mucks at Thirdhome want an internal use application to view the contents of one of our Property listing APIs. We have built a frontend for consuming the "discounted weeks" API. This application has a service in `lib/` and two jobs that can be used to sync with our API and load relevant data into the tables that we've already defined in this repository.  We've also provided a way to browse a list of available properties as well as a way to view each property individually, with its available weeks. Please start by using these jobs to load the relevant data into your data. You may need to review the schema and/or the views to confirm that you have all of the correct model properties.

Beyond this basic functionality, a critical piece of this is building the ability to recommend properties to Users.  We have a seed file that should generate a set of users with different interests.  We want you to build a recommendation system that will match each user with properties that match the User's interests. In the interface, we would like a page that would display the top 3 properties for each user, ordered by how closely the property matches the interests of the user.  The various interests are listed below and are somewhat vague.  Defining a reasonable algorithm to match properties is part of the exercise.

User travel interests:
- Cabo San Lucas
- Urban
- Spring Break
- December Holiday Travel
- Family Travel
- Mountains
- Golf
- Only Good Reviews

Feel free to add whatever gems, tables, relationships, columns, etc. are needed to accomplish the goals set out here.

### Stretch Goals

If you breeze through the above, here's a couple of other features to add.

 - Show a list of up to 3 nearby properties on the Property page, defined as properties within 50 miles.
 - Take some time to improve the frontend HTML/CSS to make the everything look a bit nicer.

### Guidelines

- Tests are encouraged, but we'd rather see feature completion if it's a tradeoff between them.
- Gems are fine, but we'd rather see code that you write.
- Don't spend more than 4 hours on this.

### Evaluation Factors

We'll be evaluating the PR based on the following criteria:
- Functionality - The code should work according to the requirements without bugs
- Completeness - Edge cases are considered and, if not handled, acknowledged in comments
- Style - Code written in consistent and idiomatic ruby. We like the [Shopify style guide](https://ruby-style-guide.shopify.dev/), but it should just be consistent
- Performance - Code and queries should be performant

### Api authentication

The API uses an Authorization header to authenticate requests. It expects the following format:
`Authorization: Token token="#{api_token}"`. Your api_token is `uxFR0gP0nMwomi0ynDkA`.
