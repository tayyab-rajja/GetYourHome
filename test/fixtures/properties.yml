  description: Scotch Highlands Home at The Mountain Club at Cashiers\r\n\r\nLocated near Cashiers, North Carolina and overlooking the lushly-forested Sapphire Valley, the Mountain Club is considered one of North Carolina’s most treasured spots, just steps away from golf, tennis, swimming, hiking, and exploring the spectacular Blue Ridge Mountains.\r\n\r\nResidences at the Mountain Club were designed with vacation living in mind. Open common areas, private bedrooms, and access to the surrounding natural beauty are dominant features. No detail was overlooked when completing these luxury homes. Each one provides a different view of the spectacular mountain vistas.\r\n\r\nThe Mountain Club is an enclave of custom-designed mountain homes with wood-burning stone fireplaces.\r\n\r\nThis Scotch Highlands Loop home is a one story, with a large King master bedroom with a steam shower, one queen bedroom, one bedroom with two twins, two baths with double vanities, a large family room and kitchen. There is also a queen size pull out sofa in the Family room.\r\n\r\nThis private mountain residence club sits directly across from the entrance of the Sapphire Valley Resort. In addition to our own spacious facilities, members have access to all Resort Amenities.\r\n\r\nOur families find peace, quite, friends, and as much activity as one can experience.\r\n\r\n**This property has as a NO PET POLICY for visiting THIRDHOME Members. The ability to bring a pet is reserved exclusively to Mtn. Club Owners only; not visiting THIRDHOME members.\r\n\r\n*Please note that the photos included herein are representative of The Mountain Club at Cashiers and not the actual unit you may be reserving. Interiors, views, layout and decor will vary by unit.

There are several top rated golf courses in the area that we enjoyed, and also great shopping, dining, and hiking to numerous waterfalls in the area. The house itself was comfortable and had enough space so that the kids could entertain themselves while we relaxed.  I look forward to our next visit.",
